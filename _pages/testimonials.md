We like the breadth of ReportAlert's reach and the fact that those receiving their alerts represent a targeted audience of stakeholders genuinely interested in following CSR reporting. This far exceeds what we could accomplish on our own."</i>

I am convinced because of how fast the staff responded to my emails and my needs, and how easily our message was transmitted. The process of not having to attach the document itself, but just a limited character message was very helpful. And the ability to delay release also made all the difference."</i>
